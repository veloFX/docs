# veloFX

Make your ride come alive!  Turn any bike into a steam train, a horse, or even an outer space speeder.

VeloFX adds sound effects to your bike, to make your ride come alive.  Each sound package includes a “Go Sound”, which will play automatically when your bike is moving.  Plus, each sound package includes a “Horn Sound”, that you can play at the push of a button.  Hear your horse neigh, or fire the blasters from your space speeder.  This app works best when paired with a bluetooth speaker.

This app was born when my son asked if we could make his bike sound like the speeder from his favorite sci-fi movie.  We worked on it together, and now we want to share it with you.  We hope that the child in your life (or the child inside you!) will enjoy riding a magic bike.

50% OF ALL SALES DONATED TO NONPROFITS WORKING FOR SAFE STREETS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.  Please help support this important effort.  

Sounds adopted from Pixabay, SoundBible, and 101soundboards.
